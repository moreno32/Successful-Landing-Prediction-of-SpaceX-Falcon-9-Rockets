Project Title: "Successful Landing Prediction of SpaceX Falcon 9 Rockets"

Project Overview:
In this capstone project, we aim to predict the success of landing for SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, as a crucial factor that determines the cost of each launch. With the increasing demand for more affordable and reliable space launches, this project will provide valuable insights into the landing success rate of Falcon 9 rockets. This project will be conducted as a data science case study, following the data science methodology, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting the results to stakeholders.

Project Motivation:
SpaceX has been disrupting the space launch industry by offering much more affordable launches compared to traditional providers. This has been made possible due to the reuse of the Falcon 9 first stage, which leads to significant cost savings. The successful landing of the first stage is a critical factor that determines the cost of each launch. In this project, we aim to use data science techniques to predict the success of landing for Falcon 9 rockets, to provide valuable insights into the landing success rate and its impact on the cost of launches.

Learning Objectives:

Gain hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to real-world problems.
Familiarize with the data science methodology and its components.
Develop and evaluate predictive models using various machine learning algorithms.
Visualize and communicate the results effectively to stakeholders.
Technical Aspect:
In this project, we will use Python and its popular data science libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, itertools, pylab, and beautifulsoup. The data will be collected from SpaceX API and Wikipedia through web scraping.

Data Source:
The data used in this project will be collected from SpaceX API and Wikipedia, using web scraping techniques. The data will include information about the launches, landing success rate, cost, and other relevant variables.

Project Structure:
The project will be structured in five weeks, including an introduction, exploratory data analysis, interactive visual analytics and dashboard, predictive analysis (classification), and presenting the results.

Credits:
The project is a part of the capstone project course and is a fictional scenario to provide a taste of what data scientists go through in real life.
